I ended up using Things, all the other apps I tried in this series, in the closest way to what the developers intended. For Things, this means I used projects for actual projects, not as lists or contexts like many use. 

I didn’t fully develop my tagging system, but I set up some context tags which allows me to filter based on where I am/what I’m doing at that point. I found that most of my tasks are schoolwork related and should all just be done at a desk, so there wasn’t much point doing excessive filtering. 

I really love the design of Things, it’s the main reason I decided to try it first out of all the todo apps. It feels very fluid to use, and the inputs flow really nicely. The way projects work does require some getting used to versus the ‘lists’ that almost every other application uses, but it does make more sense, and being able to set a deadline and complete a project makes working with projects a whole lot easier. 

Now some things I would like to see improved. Firstly, the Apple Watch app only shows the ‘Today’ view and nothing else, which is a shame as I don’t have my phone with me at school and often it’s a pain opening my laptop to write down a quick homework task. I’d also like a version of Apple Reminders’ smart lists, which would allow context filtering to be much quicker. For example, I’d love to pin a ‘Desk’ context filter to the sidebar for quick access. Another note is that in an Area view the individual todos in a project won’t show up. Showing the first item in a project (the next action) on the Area page would make it a lot easier to choose what to work on.

The upcoming, or calendar view is frankly terrible, doesn’t integrate calendar events and task due times, and only has a singular timeline view, with no way to jump to a certain date. Fantastical does the integration of calendar events and reminders really well, for context.
